              <p><small> <br></br><b>Community Land Trusts (CLTs)</b> are non-proft, democratically governed
                  organizations that owns and preserves land in a given neighborhood on behalf of the community.
                  Housing,
                  public gardens, community space, commerical use, and environmental justice preservation are primary
                  examples of how CLTs are used within the United States, and New York City in particular.

                  <p>In January of 2020, the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition founded the Bronx
                    Community
                    Land Trust. The stated mission of Bronx CLT is to, “build and preserve safe, healthy, and deeply
                    affordable housing for the borough’s racially and economically diverse residents as well as
                    accessible commercial, industrial, and green spaces. The Bronx CLT advances community leadership,
                    shared wealth, and collective governance over our Bronx land to create long-term sustainability,
                    responsible planning, and equitable development that prevents displacement and gentrification.”
                    The
                    Bronx CLT has identified 26 vacant properties in the Bronx wishing to be brought under the CLT,

                    and
                    families living in the Crotona section of the Bronx through programs that expand opportunities,
                    develop
                    leadership, and build community.” Owning several properties within Crotona, the Center created La

                    Verde, a coalition of gardens in the Crotona, East Tremont, and West Farms neighborhoods of The

                    1998. The Center is currently pursuing to bring more properties and homes within a CLT model. Find

                  <p>Founded in 2014, the East Harlem/El Barrio CLT’s stated mission is, “to develop and preserve
                    community-controlled, truly and permanently affordable housing, commercial, green and cultural
                    spaces,” in the neighborhood. Further, the organization targets low-income to extremely low-income
                    residents as prioritized beneficiaries of the land trust. In 2020, Land Trust became the first CLT
                    across New York City to win publicly-owned land. Following the purchase of four buildings for $1
                    each from the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), the Land
                    Trust
                    partnered with Banana Kelly and Community Assisted, Tenant Controlled Housing (CATCH) to convert
                    the
                    developments into tenant-run, permanently affordable dwellings. Following the construction and
                    conversion process, the four buildings will be utilized as 38 permanently affordable apartments
                    and
                    3 affordable commercial and community spaces. Sixteen of the properties will be available to
                    residents at-or-below 35% of the area median income, and four of the properties will be reserved
                    for
                    people transitioning from homelessness. East Harlem/El Barrio CLT continues to advocate for other
                    community land-oriented policies such as public land disposition, the Tenant Opportunity to
                    Purchase
                    Act (TOPA), abolishing the NYC tax lien sale, and deepened city affordability requirements. Find

                  <p>Founded in 1991, the Cooper Square CLT is the oldest community land trust in New York City.
                    Located
                    in the historic Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, the Cooper Square CLT’s stated mission
                    is
                    to, “protect the homes, small businesses, and community spaces within our service area against
                    land
                    speculation and support the very fabric of a neighborhood where residents have been traditionally
                    disenfranchised by both disinvestment and gentrification.” The CLT is a steward for two projects:
                    the Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association (CSMHA II) and the Two Buildings Tenants United
                    (TBTU).
                    The CSMHA was formed in 1995. It consists of 21 buildings, with 328 units, permanently affordable
                    to
                    low-income residents. The TBTU is a recent project for Cooper Square CLT. In 2019, the New York
                    City
                    Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) approached Cooper Square to take over the
                    two rent-stabilized buildings, with 18 units each, in order to avoid foreclosure. Cooper Square
                    CLT
                    began to also provide renovations to the existing conditions for tenants and continues to assist
                    tenants’ needs within the TBTU. Find out more <b><a

                  <p>Founded in 2019, as a part of the New York City Community Land Initiative’s $750,000 budget
                    awarded
                    by New York City Council, Chinatown CLT is an educational campaign to raise awareness of the
                    concept
                    of a Community Land Trust for the Chinatown neighborhood of Manhattan. The initiative’s mission,
                    led
                    by the Chinatown Partnership Local Development Corporation (CPLDC), is, “an extension of a longer
                    history of efforts to establish a CLT in Chinatown…to preserve affordability and authenticity for
                    the neighborhood.” The collective organizers continue to build a coalition with advocates, such as
                    CAAAV: Organizing Asian Communities, to bring land into a CLT in Chinatown.

                    homeowners and tenants to ensure protections and avoid displacement. However, in 2019, the
                    organization began advocating for the creation of a CLT in Jackson Heights, Queens to, “preserve
                    community space and commercial affordability for small businesses in Jackson Heights, and to
                    prevent

                  <p>Founded in 2020, the stated mission of Brooklyn Level Up is to ensure that, “homes, businesses,
                    and
                    community spaces to belong to the people who use them,” within the Flatbush and East Flatbush
                    neighborhoods of Brooklyn. Further the organization works to maximize BIPOC entrepreneurs' access
                    to
                    small business resources and through a community land trust model. While the organization is yet
                    to
                    acquire land for the land trust, Brooklyn Level Up continues to advocate for the neighborhoods’
                    residents. During the pandemic, the organization aided 475 residents/entrepreneurs in navigating
                    pandemic regulatory changes, creating vaccine access, and easing barriers to government programs

                  <p>Founded in 2008 as a Community Solutions project, the Brownsville Partnership became a separate,
                    affiliated not-for-profit in 2019. The mission of the Brownsville Partnership is to, “convene
                    community stakeholders to harness their collective power to advance the health, safety, and
                    prosperity of the storied Brooklyn neighborhood of Brownsville.” The Partnership also supports the
                    Brownsville Plan, which is a, “collective strategy for the equitable development of the
                    neighborhood, through the lens of health, housing, and economic mobility. The Brownsville
                    Partnership works on several projects such as the Community Action for Healthy Homes, which is a
                    “survey-fix process” with a goal to improve living conditions for tenants and low-income
                    homeowners.
                    One of the most important projects for the Partnership is the development of the Brownsville CLT.
                    In
                    2017, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) released the
                    Request for Proposal (RFP) for publicly-owned, vacant lots on Livonia Avenue in Brownsville. After
                    significant community engagement and leadership from the Brownsville Preservation, a CLT at one of
                    the planned locations was established to foster community control and ownership. Find out more

                  <p>Founded in 2020, the East New York Community Land Trust’s stated mission is to “protect,
                    stabilize,
                    and expand the stock of affordable homes, locally-owned small businesses, and green spaces in East
                    New York and Brownsville to benefit low to moderate-income BIPOC residents.” Local residents
                    democratically formed a steering committee to begin envisioning a community land trust for their
                    neighborhood. While the CLT is yet to own land, they continue to advocate for the conversion of
                    publicly owned land into the CLT model. For example, the organization launched a Reparative
                    Justice
                    Campaign in 2021 to convert all vacant lots along with parking areas controlled by the NYPD into a
                    community land trust to provide needed, deeply affordable housing along community space. Find out

                  <p>Founded in 2020, ReAL Edgemere CLT was formed to, “advocate and create new, permanently

                    homeownership opportunities in Edgemere, a BIPOC neighborhood on the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens
                    that had been devastated by Hurricane Sandy.” After a thorough Request for Expressions of Interest
                    process via the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD), the CLT
                    was
                    chosen to control and redevelop 62 vacant lots in the neighborhood. The organization continues to
                    organize to ensure residents receive equitable access to city resources following Hurricane Sandy.
